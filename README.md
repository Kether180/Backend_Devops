## MiniTwit

This project allows users to post and read tweets in real-time, and involves setting up a database and implementing various features. Docker containers are used to containerize both the database and the entire application. Additionally, the app can be monitored through Grafana/Prometheus, and it follows a DevSecOps methodology with continuous integration deployment via CI/CD GitActions.

The app has been deployed on Digital Ocean and has undergone a significant refactoring process, transitioning from a Python3 codebase Flask web framework to a C#/.NET Core React.js/JavaScript implementation.
